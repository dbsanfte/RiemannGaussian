# Completed eta current reconstruction and the weighted arithmetic estimate

The user authorized the full objective on 2026-09-06: **reconstruct the
original leading current and prove the uniform weighted arithmetic
estimate**. The objective remains active until both parts are proved and
verified. The completed [signed endpoint package](eta-signed-endpoint-theorem-plan.md)
provides the actual support, gap, phase, Gaussian, and mixed-matrix inputs.

## Actual target and current status

Write `J_rho(N)` for the existing, unchanged
`pairedEtaTopPrefixFiniteEnergyLeadingFlux rho N`. Its literal kernel is the
completed head at analytic multiplicity one and the completed adjacent-moment
kernel otherwise. In the head branch the physical first time is the shifted
coordinate plus `pairedEtaLogTailCutoff(N+1)`.

The arithmetic target is a bound for

\[
 S_\rho(K)=\sum_{N<K}(2N+1)|J_\rho(N)|
\]

uniform in the upper cutoff `K`, for every actual nontrivial zeta zero.
Any allowed dependence on the zero, analytic multiplicity, and completion
factors must be explicit. This must establish the existing universal
first-absolute-moment summability statement, whose equivalence to RH is
already proved in `EtaEnergyLeadingFluxKernel.lean`. Neither that arithmetic
bound nor RH is currently proved. Reconstruction alone does not complete
the objective.

## Checked reconstruction

Let `G_(sigma,h,tau,k,phi,psi)(t,u,w)` be the existing ordered complex
gap-return core. Its exact identity with two actual commutators has a
negative sign. Before specializing any phase, the new bound is

\[
 |G(t,u,w)|\le
 \frac{e^{-(\sigma+\tau)w/2}}{A(h)A(k)},\qquad
 A(h)=2\sqrt\pi\sqrt2h,
\]

for nonnegative physical endpoint times and tilts, and positive widths.
The literal current is integrable on its finite measure, and the exponential
is integrable on the entire gap when `sigma+tau>0`. Their product proves
genuine three-time integrability. Fubini connects the integrated existing
pairing to the literal current-gap product integral. The negative ordered
two-transition identity survives this integration.

For equal tilts `a>0`, equal widths `h`, and zero probe phases, define

\[
 M(a)=\int_{\mathrm{gap}}e^{-aw}\,dw>0,\qquad
 R_{\rho,N}(a,h)=\frac{8\pi h^2}{M(a)}
 \int_{\mathrm{gap}}\mathrm{GapReturnPairing}_{\rho,N}(a,h,a,h,0,0;w)\,dw.
\]

`pairedEtaLeadingCurrentNormalizedGapReturn` is exactly this normalization of
the existing pairing. Positivity of `M(a)` uses the actual first nonempty gap
interval, and `A(h)^2=8*pi*h^2` is separately proved. Removing the two Gaussian
amplitudes gives the exact profile

\[
 e^{-a(t+u)/2}e^{-aw}
 \exp\left[-\frac{(w-t)^2+(u-w)^2}{8h^2}\right].
\]

It is dominated by `exp(-a*w)` and tends to the same expression without the
Gaussian. Dominated convergence on the actual current-gap product proves

\[
 R_{\rho,N}(a,h)\longrightarrow
 T_{\rho,N}(a)=\int J_{\rho,N}(t,u)e^{-a(t+u)/2}\,d\mu_{\rho,N}(t,u)
 \quad(h\to\infty).
\]

A second dominated-convergence argument proves

\[
 T_{\rho,N}(a)\longrightarrow J_\rho(N)\quad(a\to0^+).
\]

The Lean endpoint is the existing `pairedEtaTopPrefixFiniteEnergyLeadingFlux`,
using the proved exhaustive multiplicity formulas. The completed current is
never replaced by its positive envelope. The raw ordered phase kernel remains
available upstream; only the reconstruction specialization sets the added
probe phases to zero. The ordinate phase inside the completed current remains.

## Checked quantitative error

The new scalar multiplier is the exact gap-time average

\[
 Q_{a,h}(t,u)=\frac1{M(a)}\int_{\mathrm{gap}}e^{-aw}
  \exp\left[-\frac{(w-t)^2+(u-w)^2}{8h^2}\right]\,dw.
\]

It is measurable, genuinely integrable, and between zero and one. Its exact
signed difference from one is retained as an integral before bounding it.
Let `M₂(a)=integral_gap w² exp(-aw) dw`. Lean proves

\[
 0\le M_2(a)\le 2/a^3,\qquad
 |Q_{a,h}(t,u)-1|\le\frac{M_2(a)/M(a)+t^2+u^2}{h^2}.
\]

For `0<a≤1`, monotonicity of the actual gap mass gives
`M₂(a)/M(a) ≤ 2/(M(1)a³)`, with `M(1)>0` proved earlier.
Fubini now identifies the normalized return exactly with the original
current integral against `exp(-a(t+u)/2)*Q`. Consequently its signed error
is the integral of the original current times that multiplier minus one.

The two physical times are proved to lie in `[0,L_N]`, where
`L_N=pairedEtaLogTailCutoff(N+2)=log(2N+5)`, also for the translated head.
Writing `B_rho(N)` for the actual selected kernel's integral of absolute
value, `pairedEtaLeadingCurrentNormalizedGapReturn_error_le` proves

\[
 \|R_{\rho,N}(a,h)-J_\rho(N)\|
 \le B_\rho(N)\left[aL_N+
   \frac{M_2(a)/M(a)+2L_N^2}{h^2}\right].
\]

The small-tilt corollary replaces the moment ratio by `2/(M(1)a³)`.
The factor `B_rho(N)` is finite by the existing genuine kernel integrability.
Its arithmetic growth is now bounded as described below; it has not been
assumed summable across cutoffs. The reconstruction estimate controls the
error of replacing the current by its exact return. The separate weighted
arithmetic target remains unchanged.

## Checked completed kernel mass

Write `sigma=Re rho`, `tau=1-sigma`, and let `W_rho` and `W_partner` be the
existing completed Laplace weights. Every actual zero has `0<sigma,tau<1`.
The finite eta measures are now proved dominated by the full positive-time
Lebesgue measure, giving exponential masses at most `1/sigma`. Their product
has mass at most `1/sigma²`. On the distinct translated head, the first mass
is instead at most the actual cutoff increment `delta_(N+1)`.

The actual head kernel is bounded by twice the sum of its two completed
exponentials at the restored physical coordinate. The adjacent kernel keeps
`2(m-1)delta_(N+1)`, and its centered powers are at most `(1+L_N)^(2m)`.
The phases and signed completion difference remain in the original kernels;
these absolute envelopes are used only downstream to control reconstruction.

Defining the explicit constant

\[
 C_\rho=2m\left[\frac{W_{\mathrm{partner}}}{(1-\Re\rho)^2}
                   +\frac{W_\rho}{(\Re\rho)^2}\right],
\]

`pairedEtaLeadingCurrentAbsoluteKernelMass_le_increment` first retains the
actual increment in `B_rho(N) ≤ C_rho delta_(N+1) (1+L_N)^(2m)`.
The all-cutoff estimate `delta_(N+1) ≤ 1/(N+1)` then proves

\[
 B_\rho(N)\le\frac{C_\rho(1+\log(2N+5))^{2m}}{N+1}.
\]

`pairedEtaLeadingCurrentNormalizedGapReturn_error_le_arithmetic` substitutes
this bound into the small-tilt reconstruction estimate. Every constant in
that result is an actual proved mass, completion weight, zero coordinate,
or analytic multiplicity. No mass bound is left as an antecedent.

## Checked simultaneous weighted reconstruction

Set `x_N=N+1`, `b_N=1+log(2N+5)`, and choose

\[
 a_N=x_N^{-2},\qquad h_N=x_N^4,\qquad
 D_\rho=C_\rho\bigl(3+2/M(1)\bigr).
\]

Every scheduled tilt is positive and at most one, and every width is
positive. The schedule has no dependence on the zero or multiplicity.
The scalar scale estimate proves

\[
 a_NL_N+\frac{2/(M(1)a_N^3)+2L_N^2}{h_N^2}
 \le \bigl(3+2/M(1)\bigr)\frac{b_N^2}{x_N^2}.
\]

Thus the actual scheduled return `R_N=R_(rho,N)(a_N,h_N)` satisfies

\[
 \|R_N-J_\rho(N)\|\le D_\rho\frac{b_N^{2m+2}}{x_N^3},\qquad
 (2N+1)\|R_N-J_\rho(N)\|
 \le 2D_\rho\frac{b_N^{2m+2}}{x_N^2}.
\]

These are the two terminal bounds in
[EtaCurrentReconstructionSchedule.lean](../RiemannGaussian/EtaCurrentReconstructionSchedule.lean).
The proof of `summable_pairedEtaCurrent_logPower_div_sq` compares each fixed
logarithmic power with a square root eventually and then uses the convergent
`3/2` power series. Consequently
`summable_oddEndpoint_mul_norm_pairedEtaLeadingCurrentScheduledGapReturn_error`
proves the required weighted norm-error series converges for every actual
nontrivial zero. The complex weighted error series is also summable, with
its signed difference retained.

Define the genuinely finite error budget

\[
 E_\rho=2D_\rho\sum_{N\ge0}\frac{b_N^{2m+2}}{x_N^2}.
\]

Lean proves that every finite weighted error sum is at most `E_rho`.
The reverse triangle inequality then gives, for every terminal cutoff `K`,

\[
 \left|\sum_{N<K}(2N+1)\|R_N\|-S_\rho(K)\right|\le E_\rho.
\]

The declaration is
`pairedEtaLeadingCurrentScheduledGapReturn_firstMoment_stability` in
[EtaCurrentWeightedReconstruction.lean](../RiemannGaussian/EtaCurrentWeightedReconstruction.lean).
This controls the difference between the two moments uniformly; it does not
bound either moment itself. All completion weights, the actual head branch,
and analytic multiplicity entered through the previously checked mass bound.
No arithmetic cancellation premise was used.

## Next mathematical obligations

1. Establish arithmetic cancellation on the retained current or return
   family sufficient to control `S_rho(K)`. Bounds for a positive heat Gram
   or a norm of a single phase channel do not establish the required signed
   completed-current bound. The small-width signed endpoint theorem and the
   broad-width reconstruction concern different regimes; a use of one to
   bound the other requires a proved intervening identity and estimate.
2. Use the proved uniform reconstruction stability to transport a proved
   return bound to the original current, without another exchange of an
   uncontrolled limit and weighted series.
3. Only after that bound is discharged, prove the existing first-moment
   summability statement and use its existing equivalence to derive
   `RiemannHypothesis`. Audit the terminal theorem, all transitive axioms,
   full library, generated status, and exact-commit CI before any completion
   claim.

## Assessment of the combined research direction

The most concrete combination is literal eta interval geometry, complex
phase probes, ordered Gaussian support/gap returns, and the completed
arithmetic current. It now preserves the first absolute-moment frontier up
to the proved finite error budget above. This is a stronger application
interface than fixed-cutoff reconstruction alone. Priority for the combined
mathematics has not been established.

The operator-theoretic theme itself has substantial prior work. Suzuki's
[2026 paper on the Weil form](https://arxiv.org/html/2606.09096v1) relates
continuous screw kernels to finite-interval operators, proves continuity
of the lowest eigenvalue, and gives a small-interval asymptotic. Its proposed
limiting spectral identification remains conjectural. The repository's
candidate contribution should therefore be judged at the level of the
specific eta arithmetic and completed signed estimates.

For a further overnight session, the useful experimental direction is an
**actual continuous comparison between heat scales with the completion
channels retained**. The following are proposed targets, not established
theorems or premises to add to Lean:

| Step | Existing input | Concrete target and acceptance condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compare ordered heat compositions on the actual domain | Full gap-time Fubini and the literal commutator factorization. | Evaluate the continuous Gaussian composition, explicitly retaining the positive-time restriction and intermediate tilt. A free full-line semigroup identity does not apply to these weighted restricted kernels without correction terms. |
| Keep all support/gap paths | The finite two-stage identity in [ProjectionHeatLeakage](../RiemannGaussian/Hybrid/ProjectionHeatLeakage.lean) and ordered cubic paths in [EtaSpectralHeatCubicPaths](../RiemannGaussian/Hybrid/EtaSpectralHeatCubicPaths.lean). | Prove the corresponding identities on the actual continuous eta measure, then pair each path with both completed current branches. Include every omitted-time and compression term with its sign. The existing finite matrix algebra alone is insufficient. |
| Test a quantitative scale comparison | The signed two-endpoint heat law, full mixed phase matrix, and the new reconstruction error budget. | Derive an estimate for the actual signed return with cutoff, phase-family size, moving tilt, multiplicity, and accumulated path error explicit. A sufficient endpoint would be a summable majorant for `(2N+1)‖R_N‖`; the exact target is a bound on its partial sums uniform in `K`. |

The decisive test is whether the zero condition and completion symmetry
supply a new cancellation in that comparison. Positive Gram bounds, a
fixed-size matrix limit, or discarding path signs cannot provide it by
themselves. In particular, fixed moving-tilt asymptotics do not control a
fixed off-axis zero: their tilt parameter grows with the logarithmic scale.
If no estimate survives these dependencies, the next result should state
the obstruction precisely rather than rename it as another RH criterion.

No reconstruction or summability premise has been introduced as an axiom.
The goal remains open because the uniform weighted arithmetic estimate is
not yet established. No `13/18` certificate or RH proof is claimed.
