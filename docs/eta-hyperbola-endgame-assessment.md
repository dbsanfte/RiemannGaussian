# Exact hyperbola split and the remaining quotient estimate

The completed current reconstruction and the original uniform weighted
arithmetic bound remain the active objective. The bound, full logarithmic
arithmetic decay, and RH are still open. The new research direction tests
the zero-dependent source reductio suggested in
`/home/dbsanfte/riemann/RiemannGaussian_hyperbola_reductio_steer-1.md`.
The memo is a research proposal, not an input to Lean's proof kernel.

The checked result is an exact hyperbola decomposition, small-half decay,
the full quotient correlation formula, and a quantitative limit for the
source retained by the large half. **The proposed vanishing operator
estimate is not proved.** No theorem excluding right-half zeros or proving
RH has been added. This package audits the proposed route; it does not
establish the conjecture-strength step.

## Actual carrier and a necessary correction to the memo

For an actual nontrivial zero `rho`, write

\[
 T_\rho(M,d)=\mu(d)d^{-\rho}X_\rho(\lfloor M/d\rfloor),\qquad
 X_\rho(q)=\operatorname{completion}(\rho)
             \sum_{n\le q}(-1)^{n+1}n^{-\rho}.
\]

These are the existing `pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusTerm` and completed
unpaired eta prefix, including its original odd endpoint. The existing
finite identity gives

\[
 \sum_{d\le M}T_\rho(M,d)=S_\rho\ne0\quad(M\ge2),\qquad
 S_\rho=\operatorname{completion}(\rho)(1-2\,2^{-\rho}).
\]

Define `low(M,D)=sum_(d≤D) T(M,d)` and
`high(M,D)=sum_(D<d≤M) T(M,d)`. The new
`pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusPartial_add_large` and
`pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusLargeAggregate_eq_source_sub` in
[EtaMoebiusHyperbolaSplit](../RiemannGaussian/EtaMoebiusHyperbolaSplit.lean)
prove their exact split and `high=S-low`.

The memo's proposed full-block reindexing is not valid under just `D<M`.
A quotient fibre can straddle that cut. For example, at `M=4,D=3`,
`floor(M/(D+1))=1`, whose complete fibre is `{3,4}`; the actual large
range is only `{4}`. Changing the upper quotient endpoint alone does not
generally supply the missing clipped block.

On the intended square-root range, however, a stronger fact resolves
this completely. `moebiusHyperbola_boundary_quotient_lt` proves

\[
 \left\lfloor\frac M{D+1}\right\rfloor
 <\left\lfloor\frac MD\right\rfloor
 \quad(D\ge1,\ D^2\le M).
\]

Hence each retained quotient fibre is wholly in the large range. With
the existing exact arithmetic block

\[
 B_{\rho,M}(q)=
 \left(\sum_{M/(q+1)<d\le M/q}\mu(d)d^{-\rho}\right)X_\rho(q),
\]

`pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusLargeAggregate_eq_quotientBlocks` proves

\[
 \operatorname{high}(M,D)
 =\sum_{1\le q\le\lfloor M/(D+1)\rfloor}B_{\rho,M}(q).
\]

This is equality of the original complex sums, with no omitted endpoint
or absolute-value estimate. On `D²≤M<2D²`, the upper quotient is below
`2D`. The fixed family sets a block to zero when its quotient exceeds the
actual upper quotient. Its reconstruction is checked at every point of
the window. [EtaMoebiusHyperbolaSchedule](../RiemannGaussian/EtaMoebiusHyperbolaSchedule.lean)
specializes this to `D_k=2^k`, `A_k=D_k²`, `M=A_k+n`, `0≤n<A_k`.

## The small half is controlled on the full square window

Let `sigma=Re(rho)` and let `C_rho` be the existing nonnegative
`pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusOriginalQuadraticConstant`. The new
`pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusOriginalMeanSquare_square_le` in
[EtaMoebiusHyperbolaLowMeanSquare](../RiemannGaussian/EtaMoebiusHyperbolaLowMeanSquare.lean)
specializes the existing quadratic sampler exactly at `A=L=D²`:

\[
 L_D:=\frac1{D^2}\sum_{n<D^2}
       |\operatorname{low}(D^2+n,D)|^2
 \le U_D:=C_\rho(1+\log D)D^{1-4\sigma}.
\]

The complete growing small-half mean square tends to zero whenever
`sigma>1/4`. This is proved both as `D→∞` and on the specified dyadic
schedule by `pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusOriginalMeanSquare_square_tendsto_zero`
and `pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusOriginalMeanSquare_hyperbola_tendsto_zero`.
In particular it applies under the hypothetical right-half-zero
assumption, without a simplicity premise. The `1/4` here is a threshold
for this auxiliary convergence theorem, not a newly proved zero-free
boundary.

## The full quotient quadratic form is retained

Let `F_D(M,q)` denote the zero-extended block family. Define the actual
complex window correlation

\[
 \operatorname{Corr}_D(q,r)
 =\frac1{D^2}\sum_{n<D^2}
     F_D(D^2+n,q)\overline{F_D(D^2+n,r)}.
\]

`pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusLargeMeanSquare_eq_quotientCorrelations` in
[EtaMoebiusHyperbolaLargeMeanSquare](../RiemannGaussian/EtaMoebiusHyperbolaLargeMeanSquare.lean)
proves the exact identity, including the complex embedding of the real
energy,

\[
 H_D:=\frac1{D^2}\sum_{n<D^2}
       |\operatorname{high}(D^2+n,D)|^2
 =\sum_{q,r\le2D}\operatorname{Corr}_D(q,r).
\]

Every cross term, the moving boundary, the completion factors, and the
normalization by the physical window length remain present. Neither
independence nor replacement by a complete period is used.

## What the large half must retain

The complex small-half average `a_D` satisfies `|a_D|²≤L_D`. The exact
source expansion in
[EtaMoebiusHyperbolaSourceLimit](../RiemannGaussian/EtaMoebiusHyperbolaSourceLimit.lean)
retains its signed mixed term:

\[
 H_D=|S_\rho|^2+L_D-2\Re(S_\rho\overline{a_D}).
\]

`pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusLargeMeanSquare_square_source_error_le` gives
the explicit downstream estimate, for `D≥2`,

\[
 |H_D-|S_\rho|^2|\le U_D+2|S_\rho|\sqrt{U_D}.
\]

Thus `pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusLargeMeanSquare_hyperbola_tendsto_source`
proves `H_(D_k)→|S_rho|²` for `sigma>1/4`. Under `sigma>1/2`, the theorem
`pairedEtaCompletedMoebiusLargeMeanSquare_hyperbola_pos_eventually`
in particular gives `H_(D_k)>|S_rho|²/2` eventually.

This is consistent with the existing full off-diagonal source diagnostic.
It does not defeat the proposed reductio: a separately proved decay
estimate under a right-half-zero assumption would contradict it and
exclude that zero. It does show that quotient reindexing and small-half
decay have not themselves removed the coherent nonzero contribution.
The contradiction has not been obtained.

## The open arithmetic target and an exponent audit

The remaining proposed estimate is

\[
 H_{D_k}\le C_{\rho,\varepsilon}
          A_k^{1-2\sigma+\varepsilon}
 \quad\text{eventually, for every }\varepsilon>0,
 \qquad A_k=D_k^2.
\]

For `sigma>1/2`, choose `epsilon=(2*sigma-1)/2`. The exponent is negative,
so such a bound would contradict the positive source limit. Reflection
would then address the opposite half of the critical strip. This is a
mathematical account of the proposed completion, not a compiled theorem
asserting that the missing estimate holds. No placeholder module or
axiom for the estimate is present.

The following checks determine what further work is necessary:

| Candidate input | What it currently supplies | Why the proposed decay does not yet follow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact quotient factorization | Original arithmetic prefix differences times the completed eta prefix. | Equality preserves the source contribution as well as the oscillation. |
| Individual term bound | Each original term has norm at most `K_rho M^(-sigma)`. | A triangle sum over order `M` terms permits an energy of order `M^(2-2*sigma)`, one full power above the requested scale. This exponent comparison is an audit calculation, not a new Lean estimate. |
| Existing power-remainder block cancellation | For every fixed positive tolerance, a uniform block bound at its natural `M^(1-sigma)` scale with a remainder. | An arbitrarily small coefficient on a positive power is not an arbitrary saving in that power. Its sum over a growing quotient family remains uncontrolled. |
| Existing divisor Fourier sampler | A window cost retaining `4*T²+L`; the useful mean-square theorem requires `T²≤L`. | The large divisors reach order `A`, while the averaging length is `A`. Reusing the small-half bound there would discard an order-`A` window loss. |
| Quotient transposition | A family with only order `sqrt(A)` quotient indices. | Its arithmetic block coefficients themselves vary with the physical cutoff. The fixed-coefficient divisor sampler does not become a uniform estimate for this moving family merely by renaming its indices. |
| Product-fibre collision energy | A proved coefficient-energy bound with logarithmic factors. | This alone does not bound the moving physical correlation operator or remove its window-dependent cost. |

The next mathematical work is on the full `q,r` form, preferably with
dyadic quotient shells and the exact moving arithmetic intervals retained.
Any proposed operator bound must display its dependence on the starting
cutoff, window length, shell sizes, and coefficient variation, and must
give a negative power for every `sigma>1/2` after a sufficiently small
epsilon loss. Bounds only for fixed quotients, or for the centered
quantity `high-S`, do not meet this target.

The prior logarithmic Möbius family remains available as a separate
arithmetic program. Its complete growing head and quadratic tail decay,
and `p_M log M→1`; the band `floor(log M)<L≤M²` is still uncontrolled.
See the [arithmetic residual assessment](eta-parity-endgame-assessment.md).
Neither that gap nor the original weighted-current objective is closed
by this hyperbola package. No sharper numerical zero strip or novelty
claim about an RH-level theorem is made.
